Chrome Extension: Creatinine Calculator

This Chrome extension provides a convenient calculator for estimating creatinine clearance using three different equations: Cockcroft-Gault Equation, MDRD GFR Equation, and 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C equation. 

Features
- Cockcroft-Gault Equation**: Estimates creatinine clearance based on serum creatinine, age, weight, and gender.
- MDRD GFR Equation**: Estimates glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender.
- 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C**: Calculates GFR using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels.

Disclaimer
This extension is intended for educational purposes and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for accurate assessment and interpretation of renal function.
